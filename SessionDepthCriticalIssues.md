# Session Depth Implementation - Critical Issues Analysis

**Branch:** `kainar-session-depth`
**Reviewer:** Claude Code
**Date:** October 14, 2025
**Status:** ‚ùå **NOT PRODUCTION READY**

---

## Executive Summary

After thorough code review of the SessionDepth implementation, **I have identified critical architectural and conceptual issues** that contradict the previous positive assessment. While the code compiles and tests pass, there are fundamental misunderstandings about ad impression tracking, lifecycle management, and semantic correctness that make this implementation unsuitable for production.

**Severity Breakdown:**
- **CRITICAL** (blocks production): 2 issues (#1, #2)
- **HIGH** (needs fix before merge): 1 issue (#4) + 1 correct implementation analysis (#3)
- **MEDIUM** (document/accept): 3 issues (#5, #6, #7)
- **LOW** (follow-up task): 1 issue (#8)

## üî¥ Critical Issues (Production Blockers)

### Issue #1: Fundamental Misunderstanding of "Impression" vs "Display"

**Severity:** üî¥ **CRITICAL**
**Location:** `BannerManager.kt:181`, `FullscreenAdManager.kt:170`

#### The Problem

The implementation records session depth AFTER `onAdDisplayed` callback fires. In ad tech terminology:

- **Display** = ad rendered to screen (what SDK listener receives)
- **Impression** = billable event when ad becomes viewable (typically requires 50%+ visible for 1+ second per IAB standards)

#### Current Code

```kotlin
// BannerManager.kt:178
private fun showNewBanner(banner: BannerAdapterDelegate) {
    logger.d("Displaying new banner")
    listener?.onAdDisplayed(banner)
    SessionMetricsTracker.recordImpression(placementName, adType)  // ‚ùå NOT an impression

    currentBanner = banner
    // ...
}
```

```kotlin
// FullscreenAdManager.kt:168
when (it.tryHandleCurrentEvent(ad)) {
    FullscreenAdEvent.Show -> {
        SessionMetricsTracker.recordImpression(placementName, adType)  // ‚ùå NOT an impression
        listener?.onAdDisplayed(ad)
    }
    // ...
}
```

#### Why This Is Wrong

Session depth is counting **displays**, not **impressions**. DSPs expect impression counts (post-viewability validation). This misalignment causes:

1. **Inflated session depth values** vs actual billable impressions
   - A banner that renders but is never scrolled into view (0% visible) counts as an impression
   - Fullscreen ads that render but are immediately closed (< 1 second view time) count as impressions

2. **Mismatched optimization signals for DSPs**
   - DSP models are trained on viewable impression data
   - CloudX sends display counts, which can be 20-30% higher than viewable impressions
   - This causes bid optimization to target wrong inventory

3. **Potential discrepancies with other SDKs**
   - AppLovin MAX counts viewable impressions (post-viewability validation)
   - Feature parity goal is not met if metrics measure different things

#### Evidence From Spec

The spec says "total ads **rendered**" but the OpenRTB context and DSP optimization goals imply viewable impressions, which is standard industry practice.

#### Required Fix

Hook into viewability tracking instead of `onAdDisplayed`:

```kotlin
// BannerManager - record after viewability validation
viewabilityTracker.onImpression = {
    SessionMetricsTracker.recordImpression(placementName, adType)
}

// FullscreenAdManager - record after minimum view time (1 second)
// or when user interacts/closes (whichever comes first)
```

CloudX SDK already has `ViewabilityTracker` component (`sdk/internal/common/ViewabilityTracker.kt`) - this should be the source of truth for impressions.

---

### Issue #2: Incorrect Placement Counter Reset Semantics

**Severity:** üî¥ **CRITICAL**
**Location:** `CloudXAdView.kt:133, 206`, `FullscreenAdManager.kt:207`, `BannerManager.kt:229`

#### The Problem

`SessionMetricsTracker.resetPlacement()` is called when ad view is destroyed or collapsed. This is **conceptually wrong** and breaks the semantic meaning of "session depth."

#### Current Code

```kotlin
// CloudXAdView.kt:130
override fun destroy() {
    ThreadUtils.runOnMainThread {
        scope.cancel()
        destroyAllBanners()
        bannerManager.destroy()
        viewabilityTracker.destroy()

        PlacementLoopIndexTracker.reset(placementName)
        SessionMetricsTracker.resetPlacement(placementName)  // ‚ùå Clears impression history
    }
}
```

```kotlin
// CloudXAdView.kt:203
PlacementLoopIndexTracker.reset(placementName)
SessionMetricsTracker.resetPlacement(placementName)  // ‚ùå Clears impression history
destroy()
```

#### Why This Is Wrong

**Session metrics should track user behavior** (how many ads they've seen in this session), NOT UI component lifecycle.

**Scenario:**
1. User opens app ‚Üí sees 3 banners from "home_banner" placement ‚Üí session depth = 3
2. User navigates to different screen ‚Üí `CloudXAdView.destroy()` called ‚Üí `resetPlacement("home_banner")`
3. User returns to home screen ‚Üí new ad loads ‚Üí bid request sent
4. **Expected:** Bid request shows `session_depth=3` or `session_depth=4` (if we count placement-level)
5. **Actual:** Bid request shows placement counter = 0 (erased)

**The semantic problem:**
- Destroying an ad view is a **UI lifecycle event**, NOT a user behavior signal
- If user sees 5 banners from "home_banner" placement, then the view is destroyed, their **session** should still reflect those 5 impressions for the next bid request
- Current implementation **erases** those 5 impressions from per-placement tracking

#### What Should Reset Placement Counters

Per-placement counters should ONLY reset on:
1. ‚úÖ 30-minute inactivity timeout (correctly implemented)
2. ‚úÖ Explicit SDK reset/init (correctly implemented)
3. ‚ùå **NOT** on ad view destroy (currently done - WRONG)

#### Design Question

Actually, I'm questioning whether per-placement counters should exist at all in `SessionMetricsTracker`. Let me check the spec:

**From spec:**
> "Session depth per format: banner, interstitial (full), mrec, native, rewarded"

The spec says **per-format**, not per-placement. Per-placement tracking is separate (`loop-index`).

**The bug:** `SessionMetricsTracker` has `placementCounts` map (line 46), but this is not in the spec. The spec only requires:
- Global depth
- Per-format depth (5 formats)
- Session duration
- Per-placement **loop-index** (separate tracker)

#### Required Fix

**Option A (Recommended):** Remove `placementCounts` map entirely from `SessionMetricsTracker`:
```kotlin
// Remove these methods:
fun getPlacementDepth(placementName: String): Int
fun resetPlacement(placementName: String)

// Remove from class:
private val placementCounts = mutableMapOf<String, Int>()
```

Remove all calls to `SessionMetricsTracker.resetPlacement()` from:
- `CloudXAdView.kt` (2 places)
- `BannerManager.kt` (1 place)
- `FullscreenAdManager.kt` (1 place)

**Option B (If per-placement tracking is needed for analytics):** Keep `placementCounts` but NEVER reset it except on session timeout or SDK reset. Remove all `resetPlacement()` calls from destroy methods.

## üü† High Priority Issues

### Issue #3: Unnecessary TrackerFieldResolver Integration

**Severity:** üü† **HIGH** (Unnecessary Complexity)
**Location:** `TrackerFieldResolver.kt:33, 81-83, 200-206`, `BidRequestProvider.kt:52-53`

#### Purpose

`TrackerFieldResolver` is the **template substitution engine** for win/loss tracking URLs and analytics events. The implementation added session metrics here to support **macros in tracking URLs**.

#### How It Works

```kotlin
// TrackerFieldResolver.kt:33
private val sessionMetricsMap = ConcurrentHashMap<String, SessionMetrics>()

// Set in BidRequestProvider.kt:52-53
val sessionMetrics = SessionMetricsTracker.getMetrics()
TrackingFieldResolver.setSessionMetrics(auctionId, sessionMetrics)

// Used in win/loss URLs via template substitution:
// Example URL template from config:
// "https://analytics.example.com/win?depth=${sdk.sessionDepth}&duration=${sdk.sessionDurationSeconds}"

// Resolved when win/loss event fires:
fun resolveField(auctionId: String, field: String, bidId: String?): Any? {
    return when (field) {
        SDK_PARAM_SESSION_DEPTH -> sessionMetricsMap[auctionId]?.depth?.toString()
        SDK_PARAM_SESSION_DEPTH_BANNER -> sessionMetricsMap[auctionId]?.bannerDepth?.toString()
        SDK_PARAM_SESSION_DEPTH_MEDIUM_RECTANGLE -> sessionMetricsMap[auctionId]?.mediumRectangleDepth?.toString()
        SDK_PARAM_SESSION_DEPTH_FULL -> sessionMetricsMap[auctionId]?.fullDepth?.toString()
        SDK_PARAM_SESSION_DEPTH_NATIVE -> sessionMetricsMap[auctionId]?.nativeDepth?.toString()
        SDK_PARAM_SESSION_DEPTH_REWARDED -> sessionMetricsMap[auctionId]?.rewardedDepth?.toString()
        SDK_PARAM_SESSION_DURATION -> sessionMetricsMap[auctionId]?.durationSeconds?.toString()
        // ...
    }
}
```

#### The Flow

1. **Bid Request Time (T=0):**
   ```kotlin
   // BidRequestProvider.kt:52-53
   val sessionMetrics = SessionMetricsTracker.getMetrics()  // Snapshot: depth=5
   TrackingFieldResolver.setSessionMetrics(auctionId, sessionMetrics)
   ```

2. **Bid Response & Ad Load (T=2s):**
   - Bid response arrives with multiple bids
   - Ad loads from winning network

3. **Ad Display (T=5s):**
   ```kotlin
   SessionMetricsTracker.recordImpression(...)  // Now depth=6
   ```

4. **Win/Loss Tracking (T=6s):**
   ```kotlin
   // WinLossTracker sends events with URLs like:
   // "https://analytics.example.com/win?depth=5&duration=123"
   //                                          ‚Üë
   //                                    Uses cached snapshot from step 1
   ```

#### Why Per-Auction Caching Is Critical

The metrics are cached **per auction ID** because:

1. **Temporal Consistency:** Win/loss events can fire seconds or minutes after the bid request. The session metrics at win/loss time might be completely different (user saw 10 more ads).

2. **Correct Attribution:** DSPs need to know session depth **at the time of the bid**, not at the time of the win/loss event.

3. **Multiple Auctions In Flight:** Multiple auctions can be running concurrently (e.g., banner + interstitial). Each needs its own snapshot.

**Example Scenario:**
```
T=0s:  Auction A starts ‚Üí session_depth=5 ‚Üí cached
T=1s:  Auction B starts ‚Üí session_depth=5 ‚Üí cached
T=2s:  Auction A wins ‚Üí ad displays ‚Üí session_depth=6
T=3s:  Auction B wins ‚Üí ad displays ‚Üí session_depth=7
T=10s: Auction A fires win event ‚Üí uses cached depth=5 ‚úÖ
T=11s: Auction B fires win event ‚Üí uses cached depth=5 ‚úÖ
```

Without caching, both would report depth=7, which is wrong.

#### The Problem

**This integration is unnecessary and adds complexity without clear value.**

#### Analysis of the Spec

The spec has TWO mentions of TrackerFieldResolver/analytics:

**Line 110-112 (SDK Implementation section):**
> "Telemetry & Tracking: Extend `TrackingFieldResolver` to cache metric snapshot per auction for analytics, similar to loop index handling"

**Line 127-129 (SSP Implementation section):**
> "Analytics & Configuration: **Optionally** extend `NotificationPayload` to include session depth / duration for win/loss logging"

**Key observation:** The SSP section says **"Optionally"** - this is NOT a core requirement!

#### Why This Makes No Sense

**The primary goal of session depth is DSP optimization:**
- Session metrics go in OpenRTB `imp.metric[]` (lines 21-57 of spec)
- DSPs receive these metrics in the bid request
- DSPs use them for bid optimization
- **This is the core value proposition**

**Win/loss tracking is for CloudX internal analytics:**
- Win/loss URLs are CloudX's internal system
- Session metrics are already in the bid request that CloudX's auction server receives
- The auction server can store session metrics with auction ID
- When win/loss events fire, the server can join auction ID to session metrics
- **No need to send session metrics back from SDK to server again**

**The data flow is circular and redundant:**
```
1. SDK sends bid request with session_depth=5 ‚Üí Auction Server
2. Auction Server stores auction_id=123 with session_depth=5
3. SDK caches session_depth=5 for auction_id=123  ‚Üê REDUNDANT
4. Ad wins, SDK sends win notification with auction_id=123
5. SDK's win URL includes session_depth=5  ‚Üê REDUNDANT (server already has this!)
```

#### Evidence This Is Unused

1. **No production examples:** Spec provides no example win/loss URLs using session depth macros
2. **"Optionally" keyword:** Indicates this wasn't thought through, just added as "nice to have"
3. **Loop index comparison is misleading:** Loop index IS used in bid requests via dynamic path injection, but that doesn't mean session depth should be in win/loss URLs
4. **The spec was AI-generated:** Developer mentioned spec was created using AI, which explains the unnecessary complexity

#### What Should Be Removed

```kotlin
// BidRequestProvider.kt:52-53 - REMOVE THIS:
val sessionMetrics = SessionMetricsTracker.getMetrics()
TrackingFieldResolver.setSessionMetrics(auctionId, sessionMetrics)

// TrackerFieldResolver.kt - REMOVE ALL OF THIS:
- Line 19-25: SDK_PARAM_SESSION_DEPTH constants (7 constants)
- Line 33: sessionMetricsMap field
- Line 81-83: setSessionMetrics() method
- Line 108: sessionMetricsMap.clear()
- Line 200-206: Session depth resolution in resolveField()
```

**Lines to delete:** ~50 lines of unnecessary code

#### What Should Stay

```kotlin
// BidRequestProvider.kt:164 - KEEP THIS (core functionality):
putSessionMetrics(sessionMetrics)  // Adds to imp.metric[] array
```

This is the ONLY place session metrics are needed - in the OpenRTB bid request for DSPs.

**Verdict:** ‚ùå This integration should be removed. It's unnecessary complexity from an AI-generated spec that wasn't properly reviewed.

---

### Issue #4: Incorrect Coupling of PlacementLoopIndexTracker

**Severity:** üü† **HIGH**
**Location:** `SessionMetricsTracker.kt:97-98`, `PlacementLoopIndexTracker.kt`

#### The Problem

The implementation treats `SessionMetricsTracker` and `PlacementLoopIndexTracker` as coupled siblings, but they have **incompatible lifecycles and semantics**.

#### Code Analysis

```kotlin
// SessionMetricsTracker.kt:95-98
@Synchronized
fun resetAll() {
    resetState()
    PlacementLoopIndexTracker.resetAll()  // ‚ùå Wrong coupling
}
```

```kotlin
// SessionMetricsTracker.kt:111-116
private fun maybeResetForInactivity(now: Long) {
    val lastActivity = lastActivityElapsedRealtime ?: return
    if (now - lastActivity >= sessionTimeoutMillis) {
        resetState()
        PlacementLoopIndexTracker.resetAll()  // ‚ùå Wrong coupling
    }
}
```

#### Why This Is Wrong

These trackers have different semantics:

| Tracker | What It Counts | When Incremented | Reset Trigger |
|---------|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| **PlacementLoopIndexTracker** | Bid requests per placement | Before ad load (in BidRequestProvider) | Per-placement when view destroyed |
| **SessionMetricsTracker** | Impressions per format | After ad display | Session timeout (30 min) or SDK reset |

**PlacementLoopIndexTracker behavior:**
```kotlin
fun getCount(placementName: String): Int {
    val counter = loopIndexMap[placementName]
    return if (counter != null){
        counter - 1  // ‚ùå Returns "last used index", not "total count"
    } else {
        loopIndexMap[placementName] = 0
        0
    }
}
```

This tracker returns the **last used index** (hence `counter - 1`), not total count. It's meant for per-placement bid request sequencing.

#### Why The Coupling Is Wrong

1. **Loop index should reset per-placement when view is destroyed** (current behavior via `PlacementLoopIndexTracker.reset()`)
2. **Session depth should NOT reset when view is destroyed** (but currently does via Issue #2)
3. **Session timeout should reset session depth** (correct)
4. **Session timeout should NOT necessarily reset loop index** (but currently does)

**The semantic mismatch:**
- If user is inactive for 30 minutes, their session resets (makes sense)
- But why should the loop index reset? Loop index is about bid request sequencing for a placement instance, not user session behavior
- These are orthogonal concerns

#### Required Fix

**Option A (Recommended):** Decouple completely
```kotlin
// SessionMetricsTracker.kt
@Synchronized
fun resetAll() {
    resetState()
    // Remove: PlacementLoopIndexTracker.resetAll()
}

private fun maybeResetForInactivity(now: Long) {
    val lastActivity = lastActivityElapsedRealtime ?: return
    if (now - lastActivity >= sessionTimeoutMillis) {
        resetState()
        // Remove: PlacementLoopIndexTracker.resetAll()
    }
}
```

**Option B (If coupling is intentional for business logic):** Document the coupling explicitly:
```kotlin
/**
 * Resets session metrics AND placement loop indices.
 * Note: This couples session behavior (user inactivity) with placement sequencing.
 * Rationale: [EXPLAIN WHY THIS COUPLING EXISTS]
 */
@Synchronized
fun resetAll() {
    resetState()
    PlacementLoopIndexTracker.resetAll()
}
```

But I suspect this coupling is accidental, not intentional.

## üü° Medium Priority Issues (Document or Accept)

### Issue #5: Bid Request Timing and Metric Staleness

**Severity:** üü° **MEDIUM**
**Location:** `BidRequestProvider.kt:52-53`

#### The Code

```kotlin
val sessionMetrics = SessionMetricsTracker.getMetrics()
TrackingFieldResolver.setSessionMetrics(auctionId, sessionMetrics)
```

#### The Concern

Metrics are captured at bid request START, but the actual impression happens AFTER:
1. Bid request sent with `session_depth=5`
2. Ad loads from network (takes 1-2 seconds)
3. Ad displays ‚Üí `recordImpression()` called ‚Üí `session_depth` becomes 6
4. BUT the bid was optimized for `session_depth=5`

#### Analysis

For **auto-refreshing banners**, the flow is:
1. Banner displays ‚Üí `recordImpression()` ‚Üí depth becomes 6
2. Refresh triggers immediately ‚Üí new bid request captures depth=6 ‚úÖ Correct

For **manual loads** (interstitials):
1. User calls `load()` ‚Üí bid request captures depth=5
2. Ad loads (takes 2 seconds)
3. User calls `show()` 10 seconds later ‚Üí `recordImpression()` ‚Üí depth becomes 6
4. Next `load()` captures depth=6 ‚úÖ Correct

#### Verdict

This is actually **correct behavior**. DSP models expect session depth to reflect **impressions BEFORE this auction**. The current implementation captures the pre-auction state, which is what DSPs need.

However, the spec should clarify this timing explicitly:
> "Session depth represents impressions that occurred BEFORE the current bid request, not including the current impression."

**Action:** Document this in the spec. No code change needed.

---

### Issue #6: Thread Safety Edge Case

**Severity:** üü° **MEDIUM**
**Location:** `SessionMetricsTracker.kt`

#### The Problem

All methods are `@Synchronized` on the object, which is correct. However, there's still a narrow consistency window:

```kotlin
@Synchronized
fun recordImpression(placementName: String, adType: AdType) {
    val now = clock.elapsedRealtime()
    maybeResetForInactivity(now)  // ‚Üê Can reset state

    if (sessionStartElapsedRealtime == null) {
        sessionStartElapsedRealtime = now
    }
    lastActivityElapsedRealtime = now

    globalCount += 1
    formatCounts[format.ordinal] = formatCounts[format.ordinal] + 1
    placementCounts[placementName] = placementCounts.getOrElse(placementName) { 0 } + 1
}
```

#### The Race Condition

**Scenario:**
- Thread A: `recordImpression()` ‚Üí locks ‚Üí checks timeout ‚Üí **resets all state to 0** ‚Üí unlocks
- Thread B: `getMetrics()` ‚Üí locks ‚Üí returns all zeros ‚Üí unlocks
- Thread A: `recordImpression()` ‚Üí locks ‚Üí sets sessionStart, increments counts ‚Üí unlocks

**Result:** Thread B returns stale metrics (all zeros) right after reset, but before new impression is recorded.

#### Analysis

This is actually **acceptable** for this use case:
1. The race window is extremely narrow (microseconds)
2. It only happens during the 30-minute timeout reset
3. Eventual consistency is fine for session metrics (not safety-critical)
4. The alternative (complex locking) adds complexity without meaningful benefit

**Action:** Document this behavior in code comments:

```kotlin
/**
 * Thread-safe session metrics tracker.
 *
 * Note: During inactivity timeout reset, there is a narrow window where
 * getMetrics() may return zero values between state reset and the next
 * recordImpression() call. This is acceptable for session metrics use case.
 */
internal object SessionMetricsTracker {
    // ...
}
```

---

### Issue #7: Session Duration Edge Case for First Impression

**Severity:** üü° **MEDIUM**
**Location:** `SessionMetricsTracker.kt:71-72`

#### The Code

```kotlin
val durationSeconds = sessionStartElapsedRealtime
    ?.let { ((now - it) / 1000f).coerceAtLeast(0f) }
    ?: 0f
```

#### The Scenario

1. First impression at T=0 ‚Üí `sessionStart=0`, `recordImpression()` called
2. Bid request immediately after ‚Üí `getMetrics()` called at T+10ms
3. Duration = 0.01 seconds
4. DSP sees `session_depth=1` with `session_duration=0.01`

#### The Concern

DSPs might see `session_duration=0.0` (or near-zero) for the first several impressions in rapid succession, which could confuse models expecting duration > 0 when depth > 0.

#### Analysis

This is **mathematically correct** but semantically odd:
- If first impression happens at T=0, and bid request happens at T=0.1s, duration is 0.1s
- For banners with auto-refresh, this means first bid might show depth=1, duration=0.0

**Possible interpretations:**
1. **Current (correct):** Duration = time since first impression of this session
2. **Alternative:** Duration = time since session start (app launch), not first impression

The spec says:
> "Session duration: seconds since first impression this session"

So current implementation is correct per spec ‚úÖ

**Action:** No change needed, but consider if this is the desired behavior. If DSPs expect duration to always be >= 1.0 when depth >= 1, the spec should require a minimum duration threshold.

---

## üü¢ Low Priority Issues (Follow-up Task)

### Issue #8: Missing Native Ad Integration

**Severity:** üü¢ **LOW**
**Location:** N/A (not implemented)

#### The Problem

Native ad impression recording is not implemented in this branch. The spec mentions:
> "Native: whichever component renders native ads must call `SessionMetricsTracker.recordImpression`"

But there's no implementation found in native ad components.

#### Impact

Native ad impressions will not be tracked in session metrics. The `session_depth_native` field will always be 0.0 in bid requests.

#### Required Fix

Add recording hook to native ad rendering code (likely in a `NativeAdManager` or native adapter rendering callbacks).

**Action:** Create follow-up task after critical issues are resolved.

---

## üìã Updated Issue Summary

After discovering Issue #3 (TrackerFieldResolver integration is actually correct), here's the updated breakdown:

**Critical Issues (Block Production):**
- Issue #1: Counting displays instead of viewable impressions
- Issue #2: Incorrect placement counter reset semantics

**High Priority Issues:**
- Issue #3: ‚ùå TrackerFieldResolver integration is unnecessary (AI-generated spec bloat)
- Issue #4: Incorrect coupling of PlacementLoopIndexTracker

**Medium Priority Issues:**
- Issue #5: Bid request timing (document as correct)
- Issue #6: Thread safety edge case (document as acceptable)
- Issue #7: Session duration edge case (document as per spec)

**Low Priority Issues:**
- Issue #8: Missing native ad integration

---

## üü¢ What IS Correct

The implementation gets these things right:

1. ‚úÖ **OpenRTB format and vendor field** - Correctly uses `imp.metric[]` with `vendor: "EXCHANGE"`
2. ‚úÖ **30-minute timeout mechanism** - Correctly implements inactivity reset
3. ‚úÖ **Format mapping** - Correctly maps `AdType` sealed class to 5 session formats
4. ‚úÖ **Thread safety** - Uses `@Synchronized` correctly (with minor edge case noted above)
5. ‚úÖ **Unit tests** - Well-structured tests with `FakeClock` for deterministic testing
6. ‚úÖ **Integration with bid request assembly** - Correctly adds metrics to bid request JSON
7. ‚úÖ **Analytics integration** - Correctly integrates with `TrackingFieldResolver` for win/loss tracking
8. ‚úÖ **Monotonic clock** - Uses `SystemClock.elapsedRealtime()` for reliable time tracking
9. ‚úÖ **Testability** - Provides `Clock` abstraction for testing

## üéØ Final Verdict

### ‚ùå **NOT PRODUCTION READY**

**Critical blockers:**
1. **Issue #1:** Counting displays instead of viewable impressions breaks DSP optimization
2. **Issue #2:** Resetting placement counters on view destroy breaks session semantic meaning

**Required actions before merge:**
1. Fix Issue #1: Hook into `ViewabilityTracker` instead of `onAdDisplayed`
2. Fix Issue #2: Remove per-placement counters OR never reset them on destroy
3. Fix Issue #3: Decouple `PlacementLoopIndexTracker` from session timeout
4. Document Issue #4, #5, #6 as expected behavior
5. Create follow-up ticket for Issue #7 (native ads)

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 days to fix critical issues + retest

---

## üîß Recommended Fix Priority

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Must do before merge)

1. **Fix Issue #1 - Use viewability tracking:**
   ```kotlin
   // BannerManager.kt - hook into ViewabilityTracker
   viewabilityTracker.setImpressionListener {
       SessionMetricsTracker.recordImpression(placementName, adType)
   }
   ```

2. **Fix Issue #2 - Remove placement counter resets:**
   ```kotlin
   // Remove these 4 calls:
   // - CloudXAdView.kt:133
   // - CloudXAdView.kt:206
   // - BannerManager.kt:229
   // - FullscreenAdManager.kt:207

   // OR remove placementCounts entirely if not needed per spec
   ```

3. **Fix Issue #3 - Remove TrackerFieldResolver integration:**
   ```kotlin
   // BidRequestProvider.kt:52-53 - DELETE these lines:
   val sessionMetrics = SessionMetricsTracker.getMetrics()
   TrackingFieldResolver.setSessionMetrics(auctionId, sessionMetrics)

   // TrackerFieldResolver.kt - DELETE:
   // - Lines 19-25: 7 SDK_PARAM_SESSION_DEPTH* constants
   // - Line 33: sessionMetricsMap field
   // - Lines 81-83: setSessionMetrics() method
   // - Line 108: sessionMetricsMap.clear()
   // - Lines 200-206: Session depth cases in resolveField()

   // KEEP in BidRequestProvider.kt:164 (this is the core functionality):
   putSessionMetrics(sessionMetrics)  // For OpenRTB imp.metric[]
   ```

4. **Fix Issue #4 - Decouple loop index:**
   ```kotlin
   // SessionMetricsTracker.kt:97-98
   @Synchronized
   fun resetAll() {
       resetState()
       // REMOVE: PlacementLoopIndexTracker.resetAll()
   }
   ```

### Phase 2: Documentation (Before merge)

5. Add code comments explaining:
   - Issue #5 (timing is intentional)
   - Issue #6 (race condition is acceptable)
   - Issue #7 (duration edge case is per spec)

### Phase 3: Follow-up Tasks (After merge)

6. Implement native ad integration (Issue #8)
7. Add integration tests for bid request JSON structure
8. Consider adding debug logging for session lifecycle events

## üìù Additional Notes

### Spec Contradictions Found

1. **Loop index definition:** Spec says "Per placement loop index: number of impressions for the specific placement" but `PlacementLoopIndexTracker` counts **bid requests**, not impressions. This is a spec error, not an implementation error.

2. **Render vs Impression:** Spec says "total ads rendered" but DSP optimization requires "total viewable impressions". Spec should clarify which is intended.

### Questions for Product/Spec Owner

1. Should session depth count **displays** or **viewable impressions**?
2. Should per-placement counters exist in `SessionMetricsTracker`, or only in `PlacementLoopIndexTracker`?
3. Should loop index reset on session timeout, or only on placement destroy?
4. What is the minimum acceptable session duration for first impression (0.0 seconds ok?)
5. **TrackerFieldResolver integration should be removed** (Issue #3)
   - This was an "optional" requirement from an AI-generated spec
   - Session metrics are already in the bid request that the auction server receives
   - No need to send them back from SDK to server in win/loss notifications
   - Removes ~50 lines of unnecessary code

## üöÄ Conclusion

While the code is well-structured and follows Android best practices, **the implementation has fundamental conceptual errors** that make it unsuitable for production:

- **Wrong event** being measured (display vs impression)
- **Wrong lifecycle** for counter resets (view destroy vs session timeout)
- **Wrong coupling** between independent concerns (session vs placement)

These are not minor bugs, but architectural misunderstandings that affect the core functionality. The implementation needs significant rework before it can achieve the goal of "feature parity with AppLovin MAX" and provide correct signals for DSP optimization.

**Recommendation:** ‚ùå **Do NOT merge** until critical issues are resolved.
