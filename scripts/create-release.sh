# CloudX SDK Release Branch Creator
#
# This script creates a new release branch from develop.
# Must be run from the develop branch.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/create-release.sh <major|minor> [--dry-run]
# Examples:
#   ./scripts/create-release.sh minor           # 0.1.0 â†’ 0.2.0
#   ./scripts/create-release.sh major           # 0.1.0 â†’ 1.0.0
#   ./scripts/create-release.sh minor --dry-run # Test without pushing
#
# Note: Patch releases are for hotfixes only and should be done
#       from an existing release branch, not from develop.
